# Property Flow

A property management application for connected portfolio records, leasing, maintenance and manual financial operations. React/Vite/TypeScript client, Fastify/Prisma/PostgreSQL API and Auth0 cookie/CSRF sessions.

## Current position

[Platform status](docs/mvp-status.md) is the current summary of implemented features, latest verified deployment, stopped development environment, this PR and remaining acceptance. [Roadmap](docs/product-roadmap.md) tracks stable feature IDs; [backlog](docs/product-backlog.md) retains detailed target acceptance. Jira updates are disabled.

The October 22 local batch adds separate vacancy/readiness and owner-controlled rental listings, inquiry/application review and draft-lease conversion, resident maintenance replies, named shared lease documents and saved lease/renewal/inspection tasks. It includes additive migrations041–045 and remains unpushed, undeployed and unaccepted. [Batch scope, checks and next work](docs/feature-batch-2026-10-22.md).

Merged source `75d5342` includes PR59 inspections, unsigned agreement preparation and personal in-app notifications (migrations038–040). Last documented deployment remains `1945049`; the development environment was subsequently stopped, and current cloud state was not queried here. The October 21 [full platform audit](docs/platform-audit-2026-10-21.md) adds local usability, navigation/form, access-race/error and dependency improvements. [Updated roadmap](docs/product-roadmap.md) separates local changes, merged source, deployment and real-account acceptance.

## Local development and validation

The hosted application can remain stopped while features are built/tested locally. Follow [repository guidance](AGENTS.md) and [validation instructions](docs/agent-validation.md). Build with `npm run build --workspace=@property-flow/client`; the server's compile-only database URL is documented in that guide. Disposable runners create their own isolated local databases/browser fixtures; never point tests at development, preview or customer databases.

Preserve current source/audit history and company/property authorization. Staff execution requires explicit capability and current assignment/property scope; occupants do not inherit leaseholder finances. Documents remain private. Signature providers, external notification delivery and Stripe payments are not activated by this batch. The user controls approval, merge, Start and deployment.

Dated implementation/checkpoint documents retain their original evidence; their old branch names, test counts or rollout limitations are not current status claims.
